# Ubuntu Server Security Analysis Guide

## How to Provide Complete Server Configuration for Analysis

To perform a comprehensive security analysis of your Ubuntu server, I need access to various configuration files and system information. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Run Configuration Collection Script

**On your Ubuntu server (10.5.20.31), run as root:**

```bash
# 1. Connect to your server
ssh root@10.5.20.31

# 2. Download and run the collection script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thanasdinaku/ceshtje_ligjore/main/UBUNTU_CONFIG_COLLECTION.sh
chmod +x UBUNTU_CONFIG_COLLECTION.sh
./UBUNTU_CONFIG_COLLECTION.sh
```

This script will collect:
- System information and versions
- Network configuration 
- Security settings (UFW, iptables, SSH)
- Service configurations
- Web server setup (Nginx)
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Database configuration
- Application settings
- User accounts and permissions
- Security logs
- System performance data

### Step 2: Share Configuration Files

**Option A: Upload Archive (Recommended)**
```bash
# The script creates an archive at /tmp/server_config_TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
# Upload this file to any file sharing service or attach to conversation
```

**Option B: Copy Individual Files**
```bash
# Copy specific configuration files manually:
cat /tmp/server_config_TIMESTAMP/system_info.txt
cat /tmp/server_config_TIMESTAMP/security_config.txt
# ... etc for each file
```

### Step 3: Manual Configuration Commands

If you prefer to run commands manually, execute these as root:

#### Basic System Information
```bash
# System details
uname -a
lsb_release -a
hostnamectl

# Network configuration
ip addr show
netstat -tlnp
ufw status verbose
```

#### Security Configuration
```bash
# SSH configuration
grep -v "^#" /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep -v "^$"

# Firewall rules
iptables -L -n -v

# Running services
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

#### Web Server Configuration
```bash
# Nginx configuration
nginx -t
cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/legal-albpetrol
```

#### Application Configuration
```bash
# Albpetrol service
systemctl status albpetrol-legal --no-pager
cat /etc/systemd/system/albpetrol-legal.service

# Application directory
ls -la /opt/ceshtje_ligjore/ceshtje_ligjore/
```

## What I'll Analyze

### Security Hardening Assessment
- **Operating System**: Kernel version, updates, security patches
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules, open ports, network interfaces
- **Access Control**: User accounts, sudo configuration, SSH settings
- **Service Security**: Running services, unnecessary daemons
- **Web Server**: Nginx configuration, SSL/TLS setup
- **Application Security**: Service configuration, file permissions
- **Database Security**: PostgreSQL configuration and access
- **Logging**: Security event logging and monitoring

### Compliance Checks
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Ubuntu 24.04 security baseline
- **OWASP**: Web application security configuration
- **Industry Standards**: PCI DSS, SOC 2 relevant controls

### Vulnerability Assessment
- **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigurations that could lead to compromise
- **Privilege Escalation**: Potential paths for attackers
- **Information Disclosure**: Unnecessary information exposure
- **Attack Surface**: Services and ports exposed to network

### Performance and Monitoring
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk utilization
- **Log Analysis**: Security events and anomalies
- **Service Health**: Application and system service status

## Expected Output

After analysis, you'll receive:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overall security posture rating
2. **Critical Issues**: High-priority security problems requiring immediate attention
3. **Recommendations**: Specific steps to improve security
4. **Compliance Report**: Adherence to security standards
5. **Hardening Guide**: Additional security measures to implement
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Security monitoring and alerting recommendations

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- Configuration files may contain sensitive information
- Review collected data before sharing
- Temporary files are created in /tmp/ and can be deleted after analysis
- The collection script filters out passwords and sensitive tokens
- All analysis will be performed on configuration data only (no system modifications)

## Ready to Proceed?

Once you've collected the configuration data using the script above, share the files and I'll provide a comprehensive security analysis with specific recommendations for your Albanian legal case management system.
